      tag_line: "Compute and validate quality indicators for continuously-valued data using reference values."
      api_intro: "Build applications using our services (coming soon)."
      geoviqua_intro: "GeoViQua provides a set of software components and services to facilitate creation, search and visualization of quality information on EO in the GEOSS Common Infrastructure."
      validation_intro: "When computing QIs from reference data, it is important that you are able to trust the values. Thus this service computes QIs but also retains a subset of the data on which to validate these QIs, particularly the Normal distribution fit is probabilistically validated."
  simulator_specifications:
    strap: "Set ranges or fixed values on the simulator inputs."
    description: "Edit the specification to set ranges or fixed values on the simulator inputs. A complete specification allows an emulator to be trained, or sensitivity analysis performed, over the whole space."
  input_screenings:
    strap: "Identify important model inputs."
    description: "Perform screening to identify important inputs; those which have significant effect on the model output."
  designs:
    strap: "Create a sample of input points."
    description: "Create a sample of input points to train and validate your emulator. The sample of points is based on the ranges in your simulator specification."
  runs:
    strap: "Evaluate the simulator using your design."
    description: "Evaluate the simulator using your design. The output from the run is essential so the emulator knows what to fit to, and validate against."
  emulators:
    strap: "Train an emulator."
    description: "Train an emulator using your design and simulator run. Adjust design size, mean and covariance function parameters to gain a better fit."
  validations:
    strap: "See computed QIs and the validation of these on a subset of data."
    description: "Perform validation to assess the accuracy of your observed data using reference values."
  analyses:
    strap: "Quantify the contributions of different uncertainty sources."
    description: "Perform sensitivity analysis to quantify the contributions of different uncertainty sources to the overall output uncertainty of your simulator or emulator."
