Quality Emitter
============

A web application to compute a range of quantitative quality indicators at dataset level, assuming that error characteristics are homogeneous, for continuous valued data provided in either CSV format or a GECA collocation report ZIP file. XML metadata that is valid against the [Producer Quality Model][5] and [UncertML][6] schemas is automatically generated to describe the metaquality and quantitative results of the quality indicators for the dataset, which can then be inserted into an existing metadata record or included as part of a blank PQM template.

The codebase is heavily derived from the [Emulatorization tool][1] developed by [Richard Jones][2] as part of his thesis on uncertainty analysis in the Model Web and providing a set of tools for managing uncertainty in Web-based models and workflows. Both tools use the [Emulatorization API][3] - also developed by Richard - although we currently maintain a [specific fork & branch][4] that extends the API to include a new endpoint for computing quality indicators.
